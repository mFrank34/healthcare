# Healthcare Application

## Project Description

This project is a Java-based healthcare application developed to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles, system design, and the implementation of core application logic within a healthcare domain. The project focuses on structuring code clearly and translating analysis and design into a working implementation.

The application was created as part of an academic assignment and reflects the use of diagrams, class design, and structured programming practices.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Apply object-oriented design concepts in a real-world themed application
- Translate analysis and design artefacts into functional Java code
- Organise a medium-sized codebase in a clear and maintainable way
- Demonstrate understanding of system structure and data handling

## Project Structure

The repository is organised as follows:

- **src/**  
  Contains all Java source files, including the main application logic and supporting classes.

- **data/**  
  Holds processed data files used by the application.

- **untouched/**  
  Stores raw data before it is transformed or used by the system.

- **diagrams/**  
  Includes design artefacts such as class diagrams and other analysis documents created during the planning phase.

- **bin/**  
  Contains compiled output files generated during execution.

## Design Approach

The system was designed using object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and separation of responsibilities. Classes were created to represent key concepts within the healthcare domain, and their interactions reflect the relationships identified during the analysis stage.

Design diagrams provided the basis for the final implementation, with minor refinements made during development to improve clarity and maintainability.

## Summary

Overall, this project demonstrates the progression from analysis and design to implementation. It highlights structured problem-solving, thoughtful class design, and clear organisation of source code within a Java application.
